## My process

In this app, I've chosen Axios for API manipulation and also React UseContext to organize the related to the request.

As of style, I've used simple CSS, since the app is not complex.

For responsiveness, I've used CSS media query. The mobile break point is at 376px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Axios

### What I learned

I love dealing with APIs in this time was not different.

Although simple, this API brings a very funny feature, these random advices that work like fortune cookies.

This app brought me the opportunity to learn something about conditional rendering, as I used it for rendering conditionally the desktop and mobile divider inside the box.

It was also a good opportunity to deal with useEffect. I used it also to manipulate the conditional rendering I mentioned above, together with the window.screen object

### Continued development

The conditional rendering technique is a trick I will continue to use in future projects, since it makes very simple to achieve the responsiveness.
